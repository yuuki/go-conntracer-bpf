# go-conntracer-bpf

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/yuuki/go-conntracer-bpf.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/yuuki/go-conntracer-bpf)

go-conntracer-bpf is a library for Go for tracing network connection (TCP) events (connect, accept) on BPF kprobe inspired by [weaveworks/tcptracer-bpf](https://github.com/weaveworks/tcptracer-bpf). go-conntracer-bpf is implemented on top of [libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf), which is a representative C library for BPF included Linux kernel.

## Features

- Low-overhead tracing by aggregating connection events in kernel.
- BPF CO-RE (Compile Once â€“ Run Everywhere)-enabled

![Flow events aggregation in kernel](./docs/images/aggregation.png "aggregation")

## Prerequisites

### Compilation phase

- libbpf source code
- Clang/LLVM >= 9

### Runtime phase

- Linux kernel version >= 5.6 (due to batch ops to bpf maps)
- Linux kernel to be built with BTF type information. See <https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf#bpf-co-re-compile-once--run-everywhere>.

### Common to both phase

- libelf and zlib libraries

## Usage

- [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/yuuki/go-conntracer-bpf)
